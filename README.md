# Markwhen is alive and well, just not in this repository

Markwhen's components have been separated and live in other repositories under the [mark-when](https://github.com/mark-when) organization. 

The web app (the editor) is the only thing that isn't open source. Everything else (including the timeline itself and the vs code extension) is - check out the links below and the diagram of repositories image.

# [Markwhen](https://markwhen.com)

Markwhen is an interactive text-to-timeline tool. Write markdown-ish text and it gets converted into a nice looking cascading timeline.

Use the editor [here](https://markwhen.com).

This repo is for the view container, not the editor. The editor (markwhen.com) and [VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Markwhen.markwhen) are built on top of the view container.

The view container renders different views, like the timeline and the calendar. It is possible to create your own views using the [view client library](https://github.com/mark-when/view-client-library).

## Self-hosted views

**⚠️ Note that if you intend to run markwhen locally you may also want to host views locally ⚠️**

The default view is hosted from https://timeline.markwhen.com. You may want to run your own local instance of the [timeline](https://github.com/mark-when/timeline) (or other view) and update [`useViewProviders`](src/Views/useViewProviders.ts) accordingly:

```diff
/* src/Views/useViewProviders.ts */
...

export const useTimelineExternalProvider = () => ({
  id: "markwhen.timeline",
  name: "Timeline",
- url: "https://timeline.markwhen.com",
+ url: "http://localhost:5173"
...
})
```

## Quick start
View container:
```sh
> git clone git@github.com:mark-when/markwhen.git
> cd markwhen
> npm i
> npm run dev
```

(Optional) Run the timeline view locally:
```sh
> git clone git@github.com:mark-when/timeline.git
> cd timeline
> npm i
> npm run dev
```

(Optional) Update [`useViewProviders`](src/Views/useViewProviders.ts):

```diff
/* src/Views/useViewProviders.ts */
...

export const useTimelineExternalProvider = () => ({
  id: "markwhen.timeline",
  name: "Timeline",
- url: "https://timeline.markwhen.com",
+ url: "http://localhost:5173"
...
})
```


The renderer renders whatever is given to the [`markwhenStore`](src/Markwhen/markwhenStore.ts).

To enable editing from the timeline view, set [`editorOrchestrator.editable`](src/EditorOrchestrator/editorOrchestratorStore.ts) to `true`:

```
const editable = ref(true);
```

## Dockerized

```
> git clone git@github.com:mark-when/markwhen.git
> cd markwhen
> docker build -t markwhen .
> docker run -p8080:8080 markwhen
```

This should build a _development_ `markwhen` image from the [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile) and run it on port `8080`. Once running, it should be available at http://localhost:8080
