Markwhen is an interactive text-to-timeline tool. Write markdown-ish text and it gets converted into a nice looking cascading timeline.

This repo is for the view container, not the timeline.

The view container renders different views, like the timeline and the calendar. It is possible to create your own views using the [view client library](https://github.com/mark-when/view-client-library).

## Quick start
View container:
```sh
> git clone git@github.com:atyrode/markwhen_view.git
> cd markwhen_view
> npm i
> npm run dev
```

Timeline view:
```sh
> git clone git@github.com:atyrode/markwhen_timeline.git
> cd markwhen_timeline
> npm i
> npm run dev
```
